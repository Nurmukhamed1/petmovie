## Project Title: Movie Website for Backend Developers

# Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to develop a movie website for backend developers with business logics. The website will
provide a platform for users to view and search for movies and TV shows. The website will also provide a backend admin
panel for content management and monitoring.

# Scope of Work:

The scope of this project includes:

Designing and developing a website for viewing and searching movies and TV shows.<br/>
Developing an admin panel for content management and monitoring.<br/>
Implementing business logics for the website.<br/>
Implementing security features to protect user data.<br/>

## Functional Requirements:

**User Registration and Login:**
Provide a user registration and login system to allow users to create an account and log in to the website.<br/>

**Homepage:**
Design a homepage that displays a list of recommended movies and TV shows, as well as popular and trending content.<br/>

**Search Function:**
Implement a search function that allows users to search for movies and TV shows based on various criteria, such as
title, genre, actor, director, or year.<br/>

**Movie and TV Show Details:**
Provide users with detailed information on movies and TV shows, including synopsis, cast and crew, ratings, reviews, and
trailer videos.<br/>

**atchlist:**
Allow users to create and manage a watchlist of movies and TV shows they want to watch in the future.<br/>

**Reviews and Ratings:**
Enable users to leave reviews and ratings on movies and TV shows they have watched. Display these reviews and ratings on
the movie or TV show details page.<br/>

**Recommendations:**
Implement a recommendation system that suggests movies and TV shows based on the user's viewing history, search queries,
and watchlist. The recommendation system should use machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to make
accurate and relevant recommendations.<br/>

**Content Filtering:**
Add content filtering options to the search function, such as genre, year, rating, and language. Users should be able to
apply multiple filters at once to refine their search results.<br/>

**Social Media Integration:**
Integrate the website with popular social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, to allow users to share movie
and TV show recommendations with their friends and followers.<br/>

**User Activity Tracking:**
Track user activity on the website, such as search queries, page views, and watchlist additions. This data should be
used to improve the recommendation system and personalize the user's viewing experience.<br/>

**Multiple Languages Support:**
Provide support for multiple languages, allowing users to switch between languages and view movie and TV show
information in their preferred language.<br/>

**User Privacy:**
Ensure that user data, such as login credentials and personal information, is stored securely and protected from
unauthorized access. Implement data encryption and user authentication and authorization features to ensure user
privacy.<br/>

**Payment Integration:**
Implement payment integration for premium content, such as movies and TV shows that require a subscription or rental
fee. Users should be able to make payments securely and easily through the website.<br/>

**Premium Users Logic:**
Implement a premium users system that offers additional features to users who pay for a subscription. Premium users
should be able to access exclusive content, watch movies and TV shows without ads, and get early access to new
releases.<br/>

**Admin Panel:**
Develop an admin panel that allows administrators to manage and monitor content on the website. This includes adding,
updating, and deleting movies and TV shows, as well as managing user accounts and viewing website analytics.<br/>

**Mobile Optimization:**
Ensure that the website is optimized for mobile devices, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for users
accessing the website from their smartphones or tablets.<br/>

Each of these functional requirements will contribute to creating a comprehensive and engaging movie website for backend
developers. The premium users logic will provide an additional revenue stream for the website and allow for the
implementation of more advanced features.<br/>

## Technical Requirements:

• The website should be developed using a backend framework such as Django or Flask.<br/>
• The database should be designed using a relational database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.<br/>
• The website should be hosted on a secure server using HTTPS encryption.<br/>
• The website should be scalable and able to handle a high volume of traffic.<br/>
• The website should be optimized for speed and performance.<br/>

## Deliverables:

• A fully functional movie website with a user registration and login system, homepage with movie and TV show listings,
search function, user profile page, and admin panel for content management and monitoring.<br/>
• The website should be fully tested and free of bugs.<br/>
• Technical documentation and user manuals for the website and admin panel.<br/>

## Project Timeline:

## The project timeline will be divided into the following phases:

• Phase 1: Requirements gathering and analysis (1 week)<br/>
• Phase 2: Design and development (8 weeks)<br/>
• Phase 3: Testing and bug fixing (2 weeks)<br/>
• Phase 4: Deployment and documentation (1 week)<br/>

Budget:
The project budget is $20,000. This includes all development costs, server hosting, and testing. Any additional costs
must be approved by the project manager before being incurred.<br/>

Project Manager:
The project manager will be responsible for overseeing the project and ensuring that it is delivered on time, within
budget, and meets the requirements specified in this terms of reference. The project manager will also be responsible
for communicating with the development team and providing regular updates to stakeholders.
